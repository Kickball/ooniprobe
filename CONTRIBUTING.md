# Welcome #

I'm very glad you're thinking about contributing to this open source project!  If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway.  The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something.  I appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, I encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), the [LICENSE](LICENSE), and the [README](README.md), all of which should be in this repository.

## Issues ##

If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, the easiest method is to [create an issue](https://github.com/kickball/ooniprobe/issues) in this repository.  I recommend that you first search through existing issues (both open and closed) to check if your particular issue has already been reported.  If it has then you might want to add a comment to the existing issue.  If it hasn't then feel free to create a new one.

## Pull requests ##

If you choose to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/kickball/ooniprobe/pulls), you will notice that our continuous integration (CI) system runs some tests or checks.  Your pull request may fail these checks, and that's OK.  If you want you can stop there and wait for us to make the necessary corrections to ensure your code passes the CI checks.

## Standards ##

There are a few standards that the project follows, these include:
*  [Semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

Ideally your contributions would follow these as well, but do not worry if you're not sure about them, reach out and I can help.
